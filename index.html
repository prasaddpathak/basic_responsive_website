                    <p>Manchester United was the second highest-earning football club in the world for 2013–14, with an annual revenue of €518 million, and the world's third most valuable football club in 2015, valued at $1.98 billion. As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The club holds several rivalries, most notably with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United, and more recently with Arsenal.</p>
